Have you met the problem that you want to log some information in the console prompt? If you try to use `Console.WrirteLine` method, the output window prompt may not appear. That's because if a process doesn't have a related console, then the `Console.Error` and the `Console.Out` are backed by the `Stream.Null`, so you wouldn't see anything output.

You can switch to a non-IIS profile to make the `Console.WrirteLine` method works. For more detailed information, [look here][1].


In this article, I will discuss other ways of achieving it more artistic. This blog mainly divided into three parts. Each part represents a specific scenario, which you may log information.

# ASP.NET CORE Web
It's easy to log information in the ***ASP.NET CORE web application*** because of the `ILogger` is a built-in service. The IoC container will contain it automatically as the project start.

You can inject it via the constructor injection or the action injection. The following code injected an `ILogger` instance via the constructor injection.
```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class HomeController
{
  public ILogger<HomeController> logger;
  public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> _logger)
  {
    logger = _logger;
  }

  public IActionResult Index()
  {
    logger.LogInformation("index action invoked.");
    return View();
  }
}
```

# .NET CORE Console Application

It's a bit complicated to log in console application. As it's a console application, so it's doesn't a built-in service as the preceding presented. So we need to implement our own `ILogger` instance.

It's important to acknowledge the structure before we manually built it. I will roughly introduce its components. Three interfaces are mainly involved are the `ILogger`, `ILoggerFactory`, and `ILoggerProvider`.

Their relationship shows the following diagram.
![Alt][2]

The `ILoggerFactory` depends on `ILoggerProvider`, and `ILoggerFactory` creates an `ILogger` instance.

Install `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` packages.
```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console
```

Then run the following code to implement logging in ***.NET CORE Console*** application.
```c#
class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    ILoggerFactory loggerFactory = new LoggerFactory(
                    new[] { new ConsoleLoggerProvider((_, __) => true, true) }
                );
    //or
    //ILoggerFactory loggerFactory = new LoggerFactory().AddConsole();
    
    ILogger logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();
    logger.LogInformation("This is log message.");
  }
}
```

# UnitTest App

It's slightly different about logging between the **XUnit** project and the **NUnit** project. The **XUnit** project doesn't support the `Console.Writeline` method, however, the **NUnit** project does. 

So, if you are running on an **NUnit** project, you can directly use the `Console.Writeline` method. If you are running on an **XUnit** project, you should use the `ITestOutputHelper` instead.

**XUnit Project**
```c#
public class UnitTest1
{
    private readonly ITestOutputHelper output;
    public UnitTest1(ITestOutputHelper output) 
    {
        this.output = output;
    }
    [Fact]
    public void Test1()
    {
        output.WriteLine("From ITestOutputHelper");
    }
}
```

**UNnit Project**

```c#
public class Tests
{
    [SetUp]
    public void Setup()
    {
    }
    [Test]
    public void Test1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("From Console WriteLine");
    }
}
```

Open an additional output for the result.
